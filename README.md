## General info
Our main goal was to examine the potential occurrence of territoriality in Spix's disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor) by analyzing the extent of overlap between roosting ranges and its association with the daily availability of tubular leaves. We also explored the possible correlation between group size, the size of roosting ranges, and the abundance of tubular leaves within these ranges.  

## Data
* [Location of groups](https://github.com/morceglo/territoriality-in-disc-winged-bats/blob/main/30UbiG_date.csv)
Key to listed variables: Fecha = date (day/month/year), ID = group identification number, x_ = longitude, y_ = latitude.

* [Data on home range and other group traits](https://github.com/morceglo/territoriality-in-disc-winged-bats/blob/main/HR_Gsize.csv)
Key to listed variables: Group_ID = group identification number, HR = size of roosting home range (ha), Gprom_size = average group size, Gcrow_size = group size based on crowding, G_crowding2 = group size based on crowding.

* [Spatial distribution of tubular leaves](https://github.com/morceglo/territoriality-in-disc-winged-bats/blob/main/leaves.csv)
Key to listed variables: Fecha = date when a leaf was observed (day/month/year), Muestreo = sample identification, Hoja = leaf number, x = longitude, y = latitude.

* [Tubular leaves in roosting home range](https://github.com/morceglo/territoriality-in-disc-winged-bats/blob/main/leaves_inHR.csv)
Key to listed variables: ID_group = group identification number, N_leaves = number of tubular leaves observed, Muestreo = sample identification, HR = roosting home range, den_leavesHR = number of available tubular leaves in roosting home range, Gcrow_size = number of bats in the roost.

* [Average data for group's territories](https://github.com/morceglo/territoriality-in-disc-winged-bats/blob/main/TGH_prom.csv)
Key to listed variables: ID = group identification number, Gcrowding2 = average group size, DenH_prom = average density of tubular leaves in each group's territory, Area = size of territory (ha), Overlapping = average overlap of roosting home range (in %), Nleaves = number of leaves.
