## General info
Our main goal was to examine the potential occurrence of territoriality in Spix's disc-winged bats (Thyroptera tricolor) by analyzing the extent of overlap between roosting ranges and its association with the daily availability of tubular leaves. We also explored the possible correlation between group size, the size of roosting ranges, and the abundance of tubular leaves within these ranges.  

## Data
* [Data for number of calls emitted per individual](Calls_produced.csv)
Key to listed variables: Bat_ID = unique identifier of individuals, Trial = identifies whether the data correspond to the first, second or third trial, Audio = unique identifier of the audio file, N_calls = number of food calls emitted, Call = whether the bat called (1) or not (0), Audio length = number of seconds recorded, Naive = identifies individuals by whether it had been previously exposed to mealworms.

* [Results of experiment 1](E1_data.csv)
Key to listed variables: id = unique identifier of individuals, trial = identifies whether the data correspond to the first, second, third, fourth or fifth trial performed, stimulus = shows which stimulus was being presented in a given trial, occ = shows the number of occurrences of a feeeding attempt, dur = shows how long bats fed for, first = determines if this trial represented the first time in which the bat fed, first_graph = in words (yes or no) based on the previous column (first). 

* [Results of experiment 2](E2_data.csv)
Key to listed variables: id = unique identifier of individuals, obs = a unique identifier (based on the video's id) of the overall test perfomed on an individual, trial = identifies whether the data correspond to the first, second, or third trial performed on an individual, stimulus = shows which stimulus was being presented, pre_calls = shows whether the bat had been exposed to food calls during a given instance (row), pre_chew = shows whether the bat had been exposed to chewing sounds during a given instance (row), pre_pn = shows whether the bat had been exposed to pink noise during a given instance (row), playlist = unique identifier of the playlist used, dist_75_cm = represents the time (in seconds) that the bat spent in the 75 cm region, dist_50_cm = represents the number of visits that bats made to the 50 cm region.
